### diagrams.net custom libraries :rocket: :metal:
This is a repo of Azure icons wrapped in libraries to be easily imported in the diagrams.net application (formerly draw.io).
These icons are sourced from the amazing [Azure & Microsoft SVG Icon Collection](https://code.benco.io/icon-collection/) by [@benc-uk](https://github.com/benc-uk).

Ben's description of the collection:
>The icons are mainly Azure related but there are various other brands and logos plus abstract/generic symbols.
>Many overlaps exist between the three main Azure icon sets, this expected, but each set also has unique icons hence their reason for inclusion. Condensing down to one merged super-set would be a huge undertaking.

You can simply click on the URLs below to open the application with the libraries already open, or you copy and paste the URLs to the libraries in the 'Open library from URL' dialog.

I also wrote a [blog post]() on this subject!
